         <h2>Experience</h2>
         <h4>American Express, Engineer III, Scottsdale, AZ</h4> <h4>January 2011 â€“ September 2017</h4>

         <ul>
            <li>
               Front-End Developer responsible for updating, and maintaining a web-based 
               tool that controls the main decisions engine for Amex card processing. 
               Whenever the business users needed access to new pieces of data from the 
               Card Member database, I created the front-end elements in the web tool and 
               tied them to the back-end.
               <li>Worked closely with Business partners for understanding the technical 
                   requirements of each business need and prepared the use cases for 
                   those requirements.</li>
               <li>Designed code modifications to meet the technical requirements of the 
                   business needs.</li>
               <li>Developed the UI using HTML, XSLT, JavaScript, and CSS for application 
                   functionality.</li>
               <li>Created forms to collect and validate user input in HTML and 
                   JavaScript.</li>
               <li>Responsible for extending application development functionality to 
                   automatically connect frontend form elements to the form validation and 
                   the message routing systems using JavaScript.</li>
               <li>Involved in quality assurance for deliverables including project 
                   design, and code reviews to ensure code met with company policy and 
                   guidelines.</li>
               <li>Worked on debugging code in Internet Explorer 9, 11, and Chrome.</li>
            </li>
            <li>
               Back-End Developer in an agile environment on proprietary middle-ware that 
               facilitated the communications of all of the pieces of the Amex card 
               processing platform. When one piece of the platform needed information 
               from another, I was responsible for creating the link between the systems.
               <li>Worked on an agile development team to deliver regular updates to an 
                   existing message routing platform.</li>
               <li>Worked with Business partners to gather technical requirements to meet 
                   the business needs.</li>
               <li>Designed and implemented new messaging routes between business systems 
                   in Java giving access to required data from the database.</li>
            </li>
            <li>
               Full-Stack Engineer in an agile environment where I expanded my work to 
               include Java, JSP, and Apache Struts.
               <li>Worked with an agile development team to design a web application 
                   using JSP, Apache Struts, and Java as a frontend to a backend 
                   database. The web app would allow the users to view and modify the 
                   backend database given they had the appropriate permissions from the 
                   business.</li>
               <li>Helped to understand Business requirements and convert them to 
                   appropriate user stories for the development team.</li>
            </li>
